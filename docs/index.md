# About Me

Hi, I'm Ryan Brue. I'm a software engineer and open-source advocate and contributor.

I got my start contributing to the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org). After being a part of that community for a while, I noticed that a lot of people were using Linux as their main operating system. I got interested in potentially installing Linux onto my main system. Then, late October of 2023, I impulsively downloaded Fedora Linux, and installed it on both my laptop and my desktop, no dual-boot, just plain fresh install. From there, I've never gone back.

I've contributed in various areas across the Linux desktop since becoming a Linux user. I created the Fedora COSMIC sig, which is set to make [Fedora COSMIC](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Fedora-42-COSMIC-Spin-Proposed) an [official spin for Fedora 42](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/FedoraCOSMIC). I also contribute to the COSMIC desktop, of which some of my favorite contributions were implementing [focus hint](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-applets/pull/328) and [toplevel click behavior](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-applets/pull/317) on the app tray, and [workspace switching touchpad gestures](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-comp/pull/342) in cosmic-comp! I've also implemented support for [power-profiles-daemon](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-applets/pull/351) in the power applet, which was needed for Fedora systems.

I write most of my code in Rust and Python, and at work I write a lot of C# code (unwillingly).

Aside from general Linux and FOSS stuff, I'm very into gaming and working out, and who doesn't love doomscrolling on their phone?
