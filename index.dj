# Ryan Brue (ryanabx)

Hi, I'm Ryan Brue! This is my site!

Nothing fancy, just plain text, maybe the occasional image. I wrote the [site generator](https://github.com/ryanabx/djot-ssg) myself.

### Who am I?

I'm in my 20s, and I'm a software developer at my day job. I really enjoy learning things outside my job though, and that includes learning new things in the software realm as well. In the summer of 2023, I started contributing to the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), and that was my first introduction into the world of open source software. In October of 2023, I made the logical next step most open source fans take and installed Linux on my main PC.

From there, I started contributing to anything that seemed interesting to me, including most notably the [COSMIC Desktop Environment](https://system76.com/cosmic) ([GitHub repos for COSMIC here](https://github.com/pop-os))

Contributing to COSMIC also got me into the Rust programming language, which is now my language of choice for most of my personal projects. Speaking of personal projects...

### Why not use Wordpress?

Because, I wrote the [site generator](https://github.com/ryanabx/djot-ssg) myself. Did I mention I wrote the [site generator](https://github.com/ryanabx/djot-ssg) myself?

I would use wordpress, but it's more fun to me to use something that I created, and write in a new hip and cool [markup format](https://github.com/jgm/djot) I found the other day. Who knows if I'll ever be satisfied with trying out random new things.
