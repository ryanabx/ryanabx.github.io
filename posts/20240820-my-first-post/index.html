I really enjoy learning things outside my job though, and that includes learning new things in the software realm as well. In the summer of 2023, I started contributing to the <a href=https://godotengine.org>Godot Engine</a>, and that was my first introduction into the world of open source software. In October of 2023, I made the logical next step most open source fans take and installed Linux on my main PC.</p><p>From there, I started contributing to anything that seemed interesting to me, including most notably the <a href=https://system76.com/cosmic>COSMIC Desktop Environment</a> (<a href=https://github.com/pop-os>GitHub repos for COSMIC here</a>)</p><p>Contributing to COSMIC also got me into the Rust programming language, which is now my language of choice for most of my personal projects.
