<h2>2024-08-20 - My first blog post</h2>
<p>After writing a <a href="https://github.com/ryanabx/simple-ssg">static site generator</a>, I decided that maybe it's finally time for me to make a blog, mainly about development!</p>
<p>This first post is just going to be a hello!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>EDIT (September 12, 2024):</strong> I am now using <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo</a> as my static site generator. Nothing wrong with my old one, I just wanted a site that was mobile friendly.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT (September 14, 2024):</strong> I'm now using <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook">mdBook</a> instead of hugo. It's even more simple than Hugo, and it just works like I'd want it to.</p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I'm in my 20s, and I'm a software developer at my day job. I really enjoy learning things outside my job though, and that includes learning new things in the software realm as well. In the summer of 2023, I started contributing to the <a href="https://godotengine.org">Godot Engine</a>, and that was my first introduction into the world of open source software. In October of 2023, I made the logical next step most open source fans take and installed Linux on my main PC.</p>
<p>From there, I started contributing to anything that seemed interesting to me, including most notably the <a href="https://system76.com/cosmic">COSMIC Desktop Environment</a> (<a href="https://github.com/pop-os">GitHub repos for COSMIC here</a>)</p>
<p>Contributing to COSMIC also got me into the Rust programming language, which is now my language of choice for most of my personal projects. Speaking of personal projects...</p>
