## 2024-08-20 - My first blog post

After writing a [static site generator](https://github.com/ryanabx/simple-ssg), I decided that maybe it's finally time for me to make a blog, mainly about development!

This first post is just going to be a hello!


> **EDIT (September 12, 2024):** I am now using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) as my static site generator. Nothing wrong with my old one, I just wanted a site that was mobile friendly.

> **EDIT (September 14, 2024):** I'm now using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) instead of hugo. It's even more simple than Hugo, and it just works like I'd want it to.

### Who am I?

I'm in my 20s, and I'm a software developer at my day job. I really enjoy learning things outside my job though, and that includes learning new things in the software realm as well. In the summer of 2023, I started contributing to the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), and that was my first introduction into the world of open source software. In October of 2023, I made the logical next step most open source fans take and installed Linux on my main PC.

From there, I started contributing to anything that seemed interesting to me, including most notably the [COSMIC Desktop Environment](https://system76.com/cosmic) ([GitHub repos for COSMIC here](https://github.com/pop-os))

Contributing to COSMIC also got me into the Rust programming language, which is now my language of choice for most of my personal projects. Speaking of personal projects...
