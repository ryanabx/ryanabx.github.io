Hi, I'm Ryan Brue! This is my site! I wrote the [Site Generator](https://github.com/ryanabx/simple-ssg) myself. It's nothing much, but it generally gets the job done!

### Who am I?

I'm in my 20s, and I'm a software developer at my day job. I really enjoy learning things outside my job though, and that includes learning new things in the software realm as well. In the summer of 2023, I started contributing to the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), and that was my first introduction into the world of open source software. In October of 2023, I made the logical next step most open source fans take and installed Linux on my main PC.

From there, I started contributing to anything that seemed interesting to me, including most notably the [COSMIC Desktop Environment](https://system76.com/cosmic) ([GitHub repos for COSMIC here](https://github.com/pop-os))

Contributing to COSMIC also got me into the Rust programming language, which is now my language of choice for most of my personal projects. Speaking of personal projects...
